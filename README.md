#Implementation of an Air Quality monitoring system
This is a guide for an Air Quality monitoring system. The sensor we use is the PMS5003 digital and universal particle concentration sensor. 
To get the measures from the device we use the STM32L072Z microcontroller which is programmed via th Mbed Studio. 
The code(pms5003.cpp) and the header(pms5003.h) used to program the microcontroller come from <a href="here on Github" https://github.com/janjongboom/mbed-pms5003"></a>
